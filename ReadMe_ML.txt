ML.py : library to import

runML.py : execution of functions imported from ML.py

TrainData.csv, TestData.csv : training and testing data set from real case

hw_train.csv, hw_test.csv : 2D training and testing data set for testing

In ML.py, there are implementations of 

1. csvRead : It reads data from a cvs file to an array (np.darray)

2. csvWrite : It writes(saves) data to a cvs file 

3. DecisionStump

4. LinearRegression

5. LogisticRegression

6. Bagging: Boot strap

7. WeightedStump : version of Decision Stump within taking weights into account 

8. AdaBoost_Stump : AdaBoost goes with weighted stump


List of functions to be done

1. MLP : multi-layers perceptron (Neural Networks)

2. Decision Tree

3. Random Forest

4. CRF : conditional random fields
